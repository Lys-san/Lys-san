First year PhD at ICube (Strasbourg, France), my thesis focuses on geometry and topology conservation of 3D shapes called LTB-shapes during discretization.\
I'm also a part time teacher at Université de Strasbourg.\
I take interest in digital geometry, mathematical morphology, illustration and music !
